ERROR:Pack:2412 - The number of logical LUT blocks exceeds the capacity for the target device.
ERROR:Pack:2860 - The number of logical carry chain blocks exceeds the capacity for the target device. This design requires 957 slices but
   only has 300 slices available that allow carry chains.
ERROR:Map:237 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for
   your design exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices reported may not be reflected accurately as
   their packing might not have been completed.

Interim Summary
---------------
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                    10 out of   4,800    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                   0
    Number used as Latches:                      0
    Number used as Latch-thrus:                  0
    Number used as AND/OR logics:               10
  Number of Slice LUTs:                      6,957 out of   2,400  289% (OVERMAPPED)
    Number used as logic:                    6,938 out of   2,400  289% (OVERMAPPED)
      Number using O6 output only:           6,215
      Number using O5 output only:             261
      Number using O5 and O6:                  462
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   1,200    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:     19
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:        19
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of MUXCYs used:                     3,828 out of   1,200  319% (OVERMAPPED)
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        6,957
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         6,947 out of   6,957   99%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of   6,957    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          10 out of   6,957    1%
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               0 out of   4,800    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
